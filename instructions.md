# Instructions

You are part of a data analytics consulting firm called **NotGPT** (tagline *Human-focused data analytics*). 

Recently, a real estate company that has acquired various rental properties in Taipei City, Taiwan has contracted out your firm to extract an analysis of the housing market. 

To achieve this, your team has been tasked with analyzing and predicting an in-house dataset that your client has collected to figure out how much they should charge for their properties. 

This repository represents a small data science project that aims to satisfy the project goal above. The sections below contain instructions as to what exactly you must complete.

Utilize documentation, your peers, readings, and classroom notes to complete this project. 

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

Firstly, you will fill in the missing code in `code/data_prep/explore.ipynb`. 

In almost all data science projects with prepared & structured data, we begin our process of data discovery by firstly "exploring" our dataset. This is a process called "[exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)" (EDA). 

In this process, you will generate various visualizations and metrics to get to know our dataset better.

You will notice that there are various missing pieces of code along with respective documentation.

Use the linked documentation and your Python knowledge to fill in these missing lines.

## Part 2: Prediction

After cleaning our data, you can now move on to *modeling* & predicting our data.

By utilizing the documentation and examples, you will create a linear regressor that predicts the unit price of a rental property in this dataset.
